#First design (structural)
First design was challanging but with Capt Silva help I finished it. I checked it with truth table done on paper
and result match. Because of that I assume it should be correct


#Second design (behavioral)
After I created second design I compared it to the first one and it was exactly the same. Because my first design is correnct I assume the second design is correnct too.
